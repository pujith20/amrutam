# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

I have divided the project into nine components as Pageone, PageTwo,PageThree,PageFour,PageFive,PageSix,PageSeven,PageEight and Footer.

I have used ReactJS Technology to create the responsive website. Also, for responsive nature, I used bootstrap.

For the icons, I have used fontawesome icons. For the slider, i have used bootstrap carousel to make it more effective.

All the components are incorporated in the App.js file into one. As the debugging can get easier, i have divided them into nine components.
